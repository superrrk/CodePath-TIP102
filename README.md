# TIP102 CodePath â€“ Practice Problems

This repo is for my own practice while going through the CodePath TIP102 course.  
It includes my solutions to problem sets and coding exercises.

## How it's organized

Each folder is a different problem set or topic.  
Files are written in Python.

## Note

These are for learning purposes only :)
